# Hi, I’m Ege Amirak

Currently conducting research at the [Izmir Institute of Technology](https://en.iyte.edu.tr/) under the supervision of [Assist. Prof. Atakan Ekiz](https://www.atakanekiz.com/lab.html), I’m working at the intersection of cancer biology and immunology, with a focus on understanding how tumors like melanoma manage to resist therapy and escape immune detection. By analyzing high-throughput transcriptomic datasets, I explore the role of long non-coding RNAs in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment, particularly how they drive immune heterogeneity and foster an immune-evasive state. I also validate these findings in the lab, aiming to connect what we see in the data with real, functional changes in cancer behavior.

In addition to my tumor-related studies, I pursue a parallel line of research on T-cell receptor (TCR) analysis, specifically investigating the biophysical and signaling properties that govern TCR proofreading kinetics. Rather than profiling tumors, I explore how subtle differences in antigen affinity shape intracellular signaling, clonal selection thresholds, and lineage commitment during thymic development and peripheral responses. To address these questions, I analyze clonal expansion, repertoire diversity, and CDR3 region features, including amino acid composition and positional variability. This work examines both tonic and low-affinity ligand-induced signaling as a continuum that guides T cell fate, with the overarching goal of understanding how early signaling events shape repertoire architecture and long-term immune adaptability.

Beyond the bench, as a Task Force member of the [young European Federation of Immunological Societies (yEFIS)](https://www.yefis.org/), I contribute to both communication efforts and event organization, playing an active role in enhancing the visibility and outreach of immunology among early-career researchers. My responsibilities include developing accessible and engaging scientific content for social media, coordinating promotional strategies, and supporting broader science communication initiatives. Through these roles, I aim to bridge scientific excellence with community engagement, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative immunology network across Europe and beyond.
