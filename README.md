# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ege Amirak

Currently conducting research at the Izmir Institute of Technology under the supervision of Assist. Prof. Atakan Ekiz, I focus on characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using high-throughput transcriptomic datasets. My work investigates how non-coding RNAs contribute to immune cell heterogeneity and influence therapy resistance and immune response in melanoma.

I specialize in integrating single-cell RNA-seq, bulk transcriptomics, and TCR sequencing to comprehensively profile the TIME. This includes uncovering transcriptional programs and clonal dynamics that drive immune dysfunction and escape mechanisms in cancer. My analyses involve dimensionality reduction, clustering, pathway enrichment, ligand-receptor interaction mapping, and T-cell repertoire profiling to investigate clonal expansion, diversity, and functional statesâ€”particularly within cancer and neonatal immune contextsâ€”with the overarching goal of linking immune architecture to therapeutic outcomes.

Beyond the bench, as a Task Force member of the young European Federation of Immunological Societies (yEFIS), I contribute to both communication efforts and event organization, playing an active role in enhancing the visibility and outreach of immunology among early-career researchers. My responsibilities include developing accessible and engaging scientific content for social media, coordinating promotional strategies, and supporting broader science communication initiatives. Through these roles, I aim to bridge scientific excellence with community engagement, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative immunology network across Europe and beyond.
