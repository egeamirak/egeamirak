# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ege Amirak

Currently conducting research at the Izmir Institute of Technology under the supervision of Assist. Prof. Atakan Ekiz, I focus on characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using high-throughput transcriptomic datasets. My work investigates how non-coding RNAs contribute to immune cell heterogeneity and influence therapy resistance and immune response in melanoma.

Separately, my work on T-cell receptor (TCR) analysis is centered on investigating the biophysical and signaling properties underlying TCR proofreading kinetics. This research does not involve tumor profiling, but instead explores how TCRs achieve high antigen specificity and how subtle variations in binding affinity are translated into intracellular signaling events. I examine how these dynamics influence clonal selection thresholds, activation timing, and lineage commitment during thymic development and peripheral T cell responses. My approach includes analyzing both tonic and ligand-induced TCR signaling, with a particular focus on how these signals shape the developmental fate and structural diversity of the T cell repertoire at early and mature stages of the immune response, with the overarching goal of linking molecular decision-making in T cells to broader principles of immune architecture and adaptability.

Beyond the bench, as a Task Force member of the young European Federation of Immunological Societies (yEFIS), I contribute to both communication efforts and event organization, playing an active role in enhancing the visibility and outreach of immunology among early-career researchers. My responsibilities include developing accessible and engaging scientific content for social media, coordinating promotional strategies, and supporting broader science communication initiatives. Through these roles, I aim to bridge scientific excellence with community engagement, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative immunology network across Europe and beyond.
